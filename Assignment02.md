# Assignment 2
### 1. The purpose of Usability Testing is that it allows us to assess how easy interfaces are to use. It allows us to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of a certain interface using feedback from actual users, instead of the opinion of experts or those who developed the interface. Usability Testing helps us improve the usability of the product by informing the design, eliminating frustrations with the interface, and improving profitability. It allows us to collect information about users' experience with the interface in a realistic setting. This is different from hueristic evaluation because in heuristic evaluation, it is experts that are reviewing the interface for maximum cost-benefit, which gives us a very different viewpoint than that of users and can sometimes be skewed.

### 4. What I learned during my pilot test is that although there are some inconvenient things about the application, such as the fact that it does not clearly deliniate how to conduct tasks like deleting menstrual cycle information, for the average user, these issues are not large enough to deter them from using the application. My user still found the application very easy to use in her opinion, although she did slightly struggle with figuring out how to delete this information. I think going through the script was easy and I enjoyed running the usability test. Something I could've done better is reminding the participant to vocalize what they are thinking and what steps they are taking to complete the tasks. I also should have double checked the script to make sure it said exactly what I wanted it to say, since I was slightly modifying the wording, which could potentially bias the responses of participants if I switch up the wording.
