# BigSis

## Design Problem Statement
As a woman, you deal with a lot of problems that are difficult to talk about, or that may feel taboo to even bring up in your everyday life. A major issue that women often do not feel comfortable talking about is their reproductive and sexual health. It can often be difficult to find personalized information regarding these topics outside of a doctor's office, and these issues are often surrounded by a combination of emotion and shame, which makes it difficult to talk about with others but also makes generalized information found online feel to impersonal. This app allows women not only to track information about their menstrual cycle in an intuitive and simple way, but also allows them to connect with women from around the world to share information and personal experience in an anonymous manner to make them more comfortable. 

## Persona

## Scenario 1

#### Persona: Kelsey
#### Scenario: 
It's a Thursday afternoon, and Kelsey's at the office. It's a slow afternoon, so she goes to the bathroom at work and realizes she just stopped menstruating that morning. Kelsey immediately wants to take note of this information so that she can finish tracking the days of her menstrual cycle and then use that information to determine which days in the coming weeks she will be the most fertile, so she can try for a child on these days and increase her chances of falling pregnant. 
#### Action: 
Kelsey opens her BigSis application, and it immediately opens to the calendar page where you input information about your menstrual cycle. She clicks on the "Input Today's Info!" button and begins to fill in her symptoms on the subsequent page. She inputs the fact that she's no longer on her period, her mood, the fact that she's experiencing back pain, and a few notes about how she's feeling. She then clicks the save button and sees that she is projected to ovulate 2 weeks after that date, and receives a window of a 2 days before and after that date as her "fertile window". 

## Scenario 2

#### Persona: Kelsey
#### Scenario:
Kelsey just started her period today, and she's feeling rather disappointed because she had been thinking she might be pregnant for the past few days. She is feeling very discouraged, and wishes that she would just fall pregnant already. She has no one she feels comfortable talking about this with. Her only friends in Los Angeles are her coworkers that she doesn't know that well, her friends from home are all at a different stage in life and cannot relate to being married and wanting children, and she feels that because her husband is a man, he does not understand her struggles. She wishes she had someone to talk to that could relate to the way she's feeling and be there to support and encourage her. 
#### Action: 
Kelsey opens her BigSis application and clicks on the "Discuss" tab. She clicks on the "Create Post" button and types out a post titled "Feeling discouraged while trying to get pregnant!". She then types out her frustrations in the body of the post and hits the "Post" button. While she waits, she uses the search bar to search "trouble pregnant" and finds various discussion posts of women who were feeling similarly to her. She browses through these posts and reads them for comfort and begins to realize tht she is not alone in her struggle. Whithin minutes, she begins to get responses from women around the world in a similar situation to hers, commenting words of encouragement and tips on her post. As soon as she sees these comments, she begins to feel supported and understood.

This is the wireframe of my project. By clicking [this link](https://xd.adobe.com/view/6d04ba6f-8f4a-4fde-7d50-810e5dece513-1b35/grid/), you will be able to see the wireframe of my application. This version lacks styling such as color and font, but ultimately gives an idea of what my final design will be capable of.

## Color Variations

These are some alternate variations that I tested out for the color scheme of my application. Ultimately, I chose the green and purple scheme seen below in my high fidelity prototype because it was accessible, clean, and aesthetically pleasing.

[This](https://xd.adobe.com/view/cc01379d-19bb-49ac-709d-7591cc490952-ba30/?fullscreen&hints=off) is the high fidelity prototype of my app. The tasks that I wanted to be able to complete are: check the alerts, input new menstrual cycle information(yes on their period, calm, and happy), delete said inputted information, comment on the first discussion post, post a new discussion post, and search for a discussion post ("Headaches during your period").
