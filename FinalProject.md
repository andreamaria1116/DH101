## Design Problem Statement
### As a woman, you deal with a lot of problems that are difficult to talk about, or that may feel taboo to even bring up in your everyday life. A major issue that women often do not feel comfortable talking about is their reproductive and sexual health. It can often be difficult to find personalized information regarding these topics outside of a doctor's office, and these issues are often surrounded by a combination of emotion and shame, which makes it difficult to talk about with others but also makes generalized information found online feel to impersonal. This app allows women not only to track information about their menstrual cycle in an intuitive and simple way, but also allows them to connect with women from around the world to share information and personal experience in an anonymous manner to make them more comfortable.
