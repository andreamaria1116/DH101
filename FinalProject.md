# BigSis

## Design Problem Statement
As a woman, you deal with a lot of problems that are difficult to talk about, or that may feel taboo to even bring up in your everyday life. A major issue that women often do not feel comfortable talking about is their reproductive and sexual health. It can often be difficult to find personalized information regarding these topics outside of a doctor's office, and these issues are often surrounded by a combination of emotion and shame, which makes it difficult to talk about with others but also makes generalized information found online feel to impersonal. This app allows women not only to track information about their menstrual cycle in an intuitive and simple way, but also allows them to connect with women from around the world to share information and personal experience in an anonymous manner to make them more comfortable. 

## Persona

## Scenario 1

#### Persona: Kelsey
#### Scenario: 
It's a Thursday afternoon, and Kelsey's at the office. It's a slow afternoon, so she goes to the bathroom at work and realizes she just stopped menstruating that morning. Kelsey immediately wants to take note of this information so that she can finish tracking the days of her menstrual cycle and then use that information to determine which days in the coming weeks she will be the most fertile, so she can try for a child on these days and increase her chances of falling pregnant. 
#### Action: 
Kelsey opens her BigSis application, and it immediately opens to the calendar page where you input information about your menstrual cycle. She clicks on the "Input Today's Info!" button and begins to fill in her symptoms on the subsequent page. She inputs the fact that she's no longer on her period, her mood, the fact that she's experiencing back pain, and a few notes about how she's feeling. She then clicks the save button and sees that she is projected to ovulate 2 weeks after that date, and receives a window of a 2 days before and after that date as her "fertile window". 

## Scenario 2

#### Persona: Kelsey
#### Scenario:
Kelsey just started her period today, and she's feeling rather disappointed because she had been thinking she might be pregnant for the past few days. She is feeling very discouraged, and wishes that she would just fall pregnant already. She has no one she feels comfortable talking about this with. Her only friends in Los Angeles are her coworkers that she doesn't know that well, her friends from home are all at a different stage in life and cannot relate to being married and wanting children, and she feels that because her husband is a man, he does not understand her struggles. She wishes she had someone to talk to that could relate to the way she's feeling and be there to support and encourage her. 
#### Action: 
Kelsey opens her BigSis application and clicks on the "Discuss" tab. She clicks on the "Create Post" button and types out a post titled "Feeling discouraged while trying to get pregnant!". She then types out her frustrations in the body of the post and hits the "Post" button. While she waits, she uses the search bar to search "trouble pregnant" and finds various discussion posts of women who were feeling similarly to her. She browses through these posts and reads them for comfort and begins to realize tht she is not alone in her struggle. Whithin minutes, she begins to get responses from women around the world in a similar situation to hers, commenting words of encouragement and tips on her post. As soon as she sees these comments, she begins to feel supported and understood.

This is the wireframe of my project. By clicking [this link](https://xd.adobe.com/view/6d04ba6f-8f4a-4fde-7d50-810e5dece513-1b35/grid/), you will be able to see the wireframe of my application. This version lacks styling such as color and font, but ultimately gives an idea of what my final design will be capable of.

## Color Variations
![color variations](https://andreamaria1116.github.io/DH101/ColorVariations.png)
These are some alternate variations that I tested out for the color scheme of my application. Ultimately, I chose the green and purple scheme seen below in my high fidelity prototype because it was accessible, clean, and aesthetically pleasing.

## [High Fidelity Prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/cc01379d-19bb-49ac-709d-7591cc490952-ba30/?fullscreen&hints=off)
[This](https://xd.adobe.com/view/cc01379d-19bb-49ac-709d-7591cc490952-ba30/?fullscreen&hints=off) is the high fidelity prototype of my app. The tasks that I wanted to be able to complete are: check the alerts, input new menstrual cycle information(yes on their period, calm, and happy), delete said inputted information, comment on the first discussion post, post a new discussion post, and search for a discussion post ("Headaches during your period"). 

## Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visibility of System Status
- In my prototype, I was not able to show a loading screen, as there is no action that canbe taken from that screen, however, if I were to have my app fully developed, I would want to include a loading screen that would give the user  feedback as to whether the application is actually starting up or not.
 - The color of the navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen ("TRACK" and "DISCUSS") turn a different color once they are selected and you are on that page. This is a great indication that the button you wanted has been selected! (Awesome!)
 
#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
- I believe my application effectively matches the real world. The components of the application, such as the calendar, the delete buttons, and the close buttons, match what is typical of the real world and are pretty standard (a rectangle with the days numbered and the days of the week and month at the top of the calendar, a small trash can to serve as the delete button, and an x at the top corner of a page as a close button). It also uses wording that is intuitive and familiar to any woman that would be using the application ("period" to denote days when a woman is on her period, "ovulating" to denote days where she is ovulating, "fertile" to denote days she is fertile, and more). (Awesome!)

#### 3. User Control and Freedom
- I made a conscious effort when designing my application to give users an emergency exit for when they select an option they did not want. 
- On the "Input Today's Info!" page, there is a large, clearly marked back button at the bottom of the screen. (Awesome!)
- On the "alerts" page, there is a clear "x" button at the top corner of the screen that the user can use to exit the alerts screen. (Awesome!)
- The navigation bar is always at the bottom of the screen and can always be utilized as an exit to return either to the "TRACK" homescreen or the "DISCUSS" homescreen. (Awesome!)
- When a user opens up a discussion post or goes to create a new discussion post, there is a large, clearly marked "back" button at the bottom of the screen. The user can hit this if they accidentally opens a discussion post that they did not wish to open. (Awesome!)
- When the user searches a phrase, there is a clearly marked "x" button and also a large, clearly marked "back" button that can be used to exit the search results. (Awesome!)

#### 4. Consistency and Standards
- The navigation buttons are always in the same spot (bottom of the page), regardless of what page you're on. (Awesome!)
- The "delete" buttons always look the same on the app, no matter what it is you are deleting. (Awesome!)
- When performing an action on the app, such as inputting information about your menstrual cycle or creating a new discussion post, the back button is always on the left hand side, and the button to advance to the next page or perform the next action is always on the right hand side. (Awesome!)
- The alert button is always in the same spot on the top right hand corner of the screen, regardless of what page you are on. (Awesome!)
- The scroll bar always looks the same and appears on the right hand side of the page no matter what the action that is being performed is. (Awesome!)
- Sometimes, the application utilizes an "x" to signify closing out of something (like on the alerts page), but then sometimes, there is just a back button, like when creating a new discussion post or commenting on a discussion post. This might be slightly confusing to a novice user who is not familiar with the application. This could be improved by including only the "x" button on all of the pages or only including the "back" button. (1)
- Ultimately, there is very good consistency between all of the pages that ensures the page is as user friendly as possible.

#### 5. Error Prevention
- On the "Input Today's Info" page, the application does not allow you to press the "save" button until information has been inputted. This allows you to avoid the error of submitting the information for today before you have inputted it. (Awesome!)
- When commenting on a discussion post and creating a new discussion post, the application does not allow you to press the "comment" or "post" buttons until something has been typed into the "comment" bar or the "title" bar of the post. This allows you to avoid accidentally posting blank comments or discussion board posts. (Awesome!)
- When you are deleting previously inputted menstrual cycle information, a discussion post you posted, or a comment on a discussion post you posted, the application gives you a warning and asks if you are sure that you want to delete the information, post, or comment. The application confirms that the user wants to complete a task before committing the action, which in this case, ensures the user does not accidentally delete information. (Awesome!)

#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
- The Homepage for the tracking function only has one instruction, and that is "Input Today's Info!". This instruction relies on recognition and not recall because it clearly explains what clicking on that button will do. (Awesome!)
- The navigation bar at the bottom of the page also does a good job at this because it clearly describes the two places that clicking those buttons will take you, to the "track" function of the application or the "discuss" function, instead of having two arbitrary symbols that users must learn the meaning of. (Awesome!)
- Things like the alert and help buttons, the x buttons, and the delete buttons are all symbols that are frequently used throughout other interfaces and aspects of life to denote the functions which they perform. For example, an x button is often included in different websites, apps, and interfaces, and it almost always serves as a button used to close whatever page you are on, which is the same function that it serves here. Making these symbols intuitive ones that almost anyone would recognize is great. (Awesome!)
- In general, all of the buttons utilized throughout the interface design, such as the "back", "save", "post", and "comment" buttons are clearly labeled with their function, which makes it so that the user does not have to memorize the function of certain buttons, and is constantly reminded of what the particular button does. (Awesome!)

#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
- An experienced user can at any time hit the navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen for "TRACK" or "DISCUSS" to return to a desired place instead of hitting the "back" button repeatedly. This is helpfu because it allows users to customize their experience and tailor it to their own personal preferences. (Awesome!)

#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
- In my design, I kept the text and information as limited and minimal as possible. For example, instead of using full sentences in the "Input Today's Info" page, I utilized one word prompts, such as "Period?", "Mood", and "Symptoms". Utilizing short, one word prompts keeps the pages from looking cluttered and ensures that only vital information is included in the application. (Awesome!)

#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
- In my prototype, I did not include any error messages, since it is just a prototype outlining a few pathways to accomplish certain tasks. If I were to fully develop my app, however, I would ensure that there were error messages in plain English that would appear if for some reason information was not recorded or a post or comment was not posted.

#### 10. Help and Documentation
- The application documents all the information that the user inputs regarding their menstrual cycle, as the dates you put in appear in a box at the bottom of the homescreen. This is helpful because it allows you to double check whether or not they have been inputted correctly, and allows you to delete or edit them if an error has been made. (Awesome!)
- The application also documents any discussion posts or comments that the user makes, and they appear on the discussion board as they are made, so the user can go back and review them and then delete them if they need to. (Awesome!)
- The application has a help button where the users can go and search any problems they may be encountering within the application. Here, they can see suggestions as to how to fix the issue, or, if the issue is uncommon, they can receive information as to how to contact customer support. In my prototype, this function is not fully built out yet, but the help button can be seen in the upper left hand corner. (Awesome!)
