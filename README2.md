# Assignment 5: Interviewing People in Context

### 1. My projectâ€™s main purpose is to help the user accomplish their goals in their sex life and to find information about their menstrual cycle and reproductive health in order to achieve these goals. I believe that my project would help them realize their need for health, safety, and for intimacy. Keeping track of their menstrual and ovulation cycles and finding information about their reproductive health allows them to have sex in a safe manner that will allow them to have emotional and financial security. Knowing information about their menstrual cycle and also their reproductive health helps them reach a level of intimacy without fear, if that is what they desire. Currently, there are a variety of ways to accomplish this goal, but none of them are completely fool-proof. When it comes specifically to tracking your period, it can be very difficult to remember to log information as soon as symptoms occur, and a lot of the time, the information that is necessary to get accurate information about your ovulation cycle gets forgotten, like what day your period started or how long your cycle tends to be. My target users are women that have begun puberty and that have not started menopause yet, so women around the ages of 13-50. They would be women who are sexually active or generally interested in their reproductive health. They would most likely be of a variety of backgrounds with a variety of expertise, since all women experience menstrual cycles and are likely to use apps like my project. Users typically would do this activity at home, but it also would be helpful for them to be able to do it on the go, as most users would choose to record this information as soon as possible so as to not forget it later. To complete that activity, they would have to document their menstrual cycle meticulously, either on paper, on an app, or on a website. If they choose to use paper because they prefer it to technology, it would be easy to lose the information, make it inaccessible if they did not happen to bring it with them, and the information would be difficult to store. Something like a website or application could be helpful, but they would most likely have to use a separate program still in order to search more information about their reproductive health other than the information they already inputted, which is inconvenient and could lead to a loss of information logged for the future. 
### For my research method, I chose to do an interview study of my subjects where I passively observe them completing tasks. Because there is no one set time that users will be using my project, and the need to track their menstrual cycles can arise at any moment, it is difficult to isolate these situations in order to observe them. Because the home environment is the place where they are most likely to have access to any notebooks, computer documents, or phone applications that they may already use to track their periods, I will be conducting my interview in their home. I plan to interview them all with the same script so as to avoid any biases or misinterpretations.

### 5. This assignment helped me learn how to conduct an interview in context. I realized that it is a little difficult to see my subjects utilizing a project like mine in context because typically, period trackers are used sporadically in a variety of settings. The biggest challenge with planning the interview is that it is difficult to predict what the respondant will say, so a lot of the questions that I had planned to ask seemed redundant because my subject had already answered the questions during a previous response. When conducting the interview, I realized it is very difficult not to prompt the subject when they are a little stuck, so I would probably make sure I had more specific and clear questions so they would be able to better understand what insight I was trying to gain by asking a particular question. This would make their responses more helpful to me in the long run. 
###   The data that I collected revealed to me that although there are applications that allow you to track your menstrual cycles and that can be used to gain information about their reproductive health, users don't usually utilize both functions of the application. In this case, it seemed as though Alex only used the application for the convenience of knowing when her period is approaching, and did not really utilize any of the insights on her reproductive health often. She seemed to want a more personalized and interactive informative tool where she could not only get general information from professionals, but where she could also discuss with others that may be experiencing something similar to her. She does not seem to appreciate the fact that there is little personalization in the insights that her current app gives her, and believes that there is no one size fits all explanation to many issues regarding reproductive health. Incorporating an aspect into my project that allows users to interact with each other and hear the perspectives and experiences of others may be more valuable to users than having generic articles about broad topics.
