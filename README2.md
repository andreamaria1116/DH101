### 1. My projectâ€™s main purpose is to help the user accomplish their goals in their sex life, either to avoid getting pregnant or to get pregnant. Another goal is to have a higher level of sexual health. A last goal could be convenience and foresight on their menstrual cycle. I believe that my project would help them realize their need for health, safety, and for intimacy. Keeping track of their menstrual and ovulation cycles allows them to have sex in a safe manner that will allow them to have emotional and financial security, and knowing when the best times to have sex without getting pregnant are helps them reach a level of intimacy without fear, if that is what they desire. Currently, there are a variety of ways to accomplish this goal, but none of them are completely fool-proof. When it comes specifically to tracking your period, it can be very difficult to remember to track it as soon as it happens, and a lot of the time, the information that is necessary to get accurate information about your ovulation cycle gets forgotten, like what day your period started or how long your cycle tends to be. My target users are women that have begun puberty and that have not started menopause yet, so women around the ages of 13-50. They would be women who are sexually active or generally interested in their reproductive health. Users typically would do this activity at home, but it also would be helpful for them to be able to do it on the go. To complete that activity, they would have to document their menstrual cycle meticulously, either on paper or on an app. If they choose to use paper because they prefer it to technology, it would be easy to lose the information, make it inaccessible if they did not happen to bring it with them, and the information would be difficult to store. 
### 2. For my research method, I chose to do an interview study of my subjects. Because there is no one set time that users will be using my project, and the need to track their menstrual cycles can arise at any moment, it is difficult to isolate these situations in order to observe them. Because the home environment is the place where they are most likely to have access to any notebooks, computer documents, or phone applications that they may already use to track their periods, I will be conducting my interview in their home. I plan to interview them all with the same script so as to avoid any biases or misinterpretations.
